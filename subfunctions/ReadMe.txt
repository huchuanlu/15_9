The codes under the folder "./Basis Functions/" are collected from the public codes of the IVT [1] method. These codes include:
	(a) Affine Transformation: 
			affparam2geom.m
			affparam2mat.m
			affparaminv.m
	(b) Incremental PCA:
			sklm.m
	(c) Warping image patches according to affine parameters:
			warpimg.m
			interp2.dll (interp2.cpp)
	(d) Draw tracking results:
			drawbox.m
			drawtrackresult.m
We would like to thank the authours for their public codes and data sets.
